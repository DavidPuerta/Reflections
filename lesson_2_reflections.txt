(1.)  What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When initializing a repository, all I need is a folder in which to initialize
it, as well as some files on which to initialize it.

(2.)  How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's the pergatory of version control.  Since many of the commits affect a
repository server-side, the staging area is a place commits can hang out
until the user has access to the internet.  Once the user has access, the
commits can affect the server-side repository.
